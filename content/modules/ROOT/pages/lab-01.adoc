== Lab 1: Exploring the RHEL Lightspeed Command-Line Assistant

RHEL 10 introduces a command-line assistant powered by RHEL Lightspeed, a generative AI service designed to help you understand, configure, and troubleshoot your RHEL systems. This feature is highlighted in section 4.24 of the release notes.

=== Objective:
Interact with the RHEL Lightspeed assistant to get help with common Linux commands and RHEL-specific concepts.

* Steps:
. Access your RHEL 10 server terminal.
. Invoke the assistant. 
+
NOTE: The release notes (section 4.24) mention the general availability of this feature. The exact command might be clad or redhat-ai. We'll use redhat-ai as a placeholder. You can verify with redhat-ai --help or system documentation.

. Let's ask for an explanation of a command:
+
[source,shell]
----
redhat-ai explain "How do I list all active systemd services?"
----

. Review the assistant's response.
+
TIP:
It should provide command examples (e.g., systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active) and explanations based on RHEL documentation.

. Try another query, perhaps about a RHEL 10 feature:
+
[source,shell]
----
redhat-ai explain "What are Podman Quadlets in RHEL 10?"
----

. Observe the contextual help. The assistant is trained on RHEL product documentation and Red Hat Knowledgebase articles, aiming to provide accurate and relevant information.

=== Expected Outcome:
* You will successfully interact with the RHEL Lightspeed command-line assistant.
* The assistant will provide helpful, context-aware explanations and command suggestions for your queries, demonstrating its value as an integrated help tool.
