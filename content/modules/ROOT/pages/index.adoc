// RHEL 10 Feature Exploration Lab Guide
== Introduction

Welcome to the RHEL 10 Feature Exploration Lab! This guide will walk you through several hands-on tasks designed to showcase some of the valuable new capabilities introduced in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10. We'll touch upon AI-powered assistance, modern container management with Quadlets, enhanced system configuration using RHEL System Roles, the updated default Python environment, and file integrity monitoring.
This lab is designed to be performed on a single, existing RHEL 10 server.

=== Lab Objectives:
* Become familiar with the RHEL Lightspeed command-line assistant for quick help and explanations.
* Learn to define and manage containerized applications as systemd services using Podman Quadlets, specifically for pods.
* Understand how to apply basic sudo configurations using the new sudo RHEL System Role with a local Ansible execution.
* Verify and interact with Python 3.12, the default Python implementation in RHEL 10.
* Implement basic file integrity monitoring using the new aide RHEL System Role.

=== Prerequisites:
* A running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 server.
* Root or sudo privileges on the server.
* Internet connectivity (required for RHEL Lightspeed and potentially for pulling container images if not cached).
* The ansible-core and rhel-system-roles packages installed. If not present, install them:
  sudo dnf install ansible-core rhel-system-roles
* Basic familiarity with the Linux command line.
* A non-root user account for testing the sudo role in Lab 3 (e.g., labuser). If this user doesn't exist, you can create one:
  sudo useradd labuser
  sudo passwd labuser # Follow prompts to set a password
