== Lab 4: Working with Python 3.12

Python 3.12 is the default Python implementation in RHEL 10 (Sections 1.1 and 4.13). This version includes various enhancements and performance improvements.

=== Objective:
Verify that Python 3.12 is the default Python version. Execute a simple Python script demonstrating f-string capabilities, which are well-established and benefit from grammar formalization in Python 3.12.

* Steps:
. Check the default Python version, Open your terminal and run:
+
[source,shell]
----
python -V
And/or:
python3 -V
----
+
TIP: Both should output Python 3.12.x.

. Create a simple Python script using an f-string, Create a file named rhel10_python_test.py:
+
[source,shell]
----
cat > rhel10_python_test.py <<EOF

system_version = "RHEL 10"
python_version_tuple = (3, 12)

# Using an f-string to format output
greeting = f"Welcome to {system_version}!"
version_message = f"You are using Python {python_version_tuple[0]}.{python_version_tuple[1]}."

print(greeting)
print(version_message)

# Example of f-string with expression
num_cores = 4 # Assume 4 cores for this example
print(f"This system appears to have {num_cores} CPU cores (example value).")

EOF

----

. Make the script executable (optional) and run it:
+
[source,shell]
----
chmod +x rhel10_python_test.py
./rhel10_python_test.py
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Or run directly with:
python3 rhel10_python_test.py
Observe the output. It should display the messages formatted using f-strings.
====

=== Expected Outcome:
* You will confirm that Python 3.12.x is the default system Python.
* You will successfully execute a Python script that utilizes f-strings, a key feature of modern Python available by default in RHEL 10.
